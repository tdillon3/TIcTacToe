# Overview

As a budding software engineer, my goal is to create engaging and functional software that provides both entertainment and learning opportunities. This project, a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, is a step in that journey. By integrating fundamental game mechanics, user input, and simple AI, I aimed to simulate the traditional pen-and-paper game in a digital format, furthering my understanding of Python and game development principles.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols: either 'X' or 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This digital version allows players to click on the grid to place their symbol and provides visual and auditory feedback for each move.

The purpose of writing this software was to challenge myself in handling user interactions, game state management, and multimedia elements within a game environment. It served as a practical application of programming concepts and the Pygame library.

# Development Environment

This game was developed on a personal computer using Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE. The code was written in Python, a high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity, which makes it an excellent choice for rapid game prototyping and development.

The following tools and libraries were used:
* Pygame: A Python library for creating video games which includes modules for graphics, sound, and input handling.
* Python's JSON library: To implement the save and load feature, allowing players to preserve their game state.
* Freesound.org: An online repository where the sound effects used in the game were sourced.

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and fixes that I aim to implement:
* Improve the AI to provide difficulty levels for single-player mode.
* Enhance the user interface with animated sprites and transitions.
* Create an online multiplayer mode to play with friends remotely.
